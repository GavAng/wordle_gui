# wordle_gui

I coded my own version of Wordle and displayed it using Python's Tkinter.

I wanted a project to push me to learn Tkinter, and since Wordle was a global trend at the time, I decided to create my own version. It replicates Wordle's colour coding algorithm, and also accepts only Worlde certified words as your guesses, i.e., you cannot enter gibberish.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install *Tkinter* by running:

> python -m pip install functools

2. Run *mainWordle.py*
3. Use your keyboard or the on-screen keyboard to play the game
